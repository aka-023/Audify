Audify is a free, open-source Chrome extension designed to make web browsing easier and more accessible, especially for users with visual impairments. Through intuitive AI chat, powerful screen analysis, and comprehensive voice control, it transforms how you interact with the web. You can freely choose between privacy-focused local AI services (Gemini Nano, Ollama, LM Studio and vLLM) or powerful cloud AI services (Google Gemini and Mistral AI).

## Key Features

-   **AI Screen Analysis**: Instantly understand webpage content by analyzing screenshots or full-page text with Gemini or local LLMs.
-   **Full Voice Control**: Use your voice to navigate, ask questions, and control the browser.
-   **Dual AI Modes**: Switch with a single click between powerful cloud AI and privacy-focused local AI.
-   **Web Page Interaction**: Tell the AI to click buttons or type text for you (e.g., "click the login button", "type 'hello world' in the search bar").
-   **Cross-Platform**: Works on any Windows, macOS, or Linux computer with Google Chrome.
